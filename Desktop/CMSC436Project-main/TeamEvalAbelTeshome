Team Evaluation - Abel Teshome

Jesse: Created the first page for the project outline that describes the application concept, its key functionality, and rough architecture
and list of android system components implemented. 

Shaun: Created the first page for the project outline that describes the application concept, its key functionality, and rough architecture
and list of android system components implemented.

Abel: Created the git repository for the project and the storyboard for the project outline with rough screenshots mock-ups
suggesting how the final app will look and how the user will navigate the app.

Comment: It is too early to determine a clear evaluation for group members. Each group member has contributed a fair amount of work so far, with no team 
member working substantially more than the other.
